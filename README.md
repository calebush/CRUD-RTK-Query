The main target of this app is to implement CRUD using the RTK-Query which is a powerful tool that enables: automatic refetch in case of any change of the data(update,delete and create), caching;RTK Query manages the automatic caching which has been motivated by other tools like Apolo client with GraphQL.


### server

This project uses the node express to implement the CRUD apis which is consumed by the RTK-Query (query and muttation).
To run the server, navigate to the node-server folder and `npm install` then start with `node index` comand or `nodemon index` if you have nodemon globally installed in your machine. 
It uses the mongodb to store the data, so you must have mongpdb installed.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
